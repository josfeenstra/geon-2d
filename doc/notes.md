### note

be very mindful of the vectors, they are not like most other 3D libraries. 
state is very much shared. If you create a line between two vectors, and then 
move one of those vectors, the line will update. this is nice for parametric business, 
but not so nice if you want to keep things clear and separated. 
when in doubt, use clone or copy!
